# 1D-HEAT-WALL-CONDUCTION-PROBLEM
In this analysis, I have examined the temperature trend of a plane wall by implementing a simulation of a steady, 1D conduction heat transfer by using numerical methods. However, I also calculated the transient case of the system for a specific time interval to see the change of the system.
